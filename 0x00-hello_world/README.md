# Project Description

This project is a collection of basic programs written in the C programming language. It covers various topics such as preprocessor directives, compilation, assembly, and basic C programming concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of C programming. Each task is implemented as a separate file and follows the given requirements, including the use of specific compilers, editors, and coding styles.

## Task Descriptions

1. Preprocessor: This task involves running a C file through the preprocessor and saving the preprocessed output into another file.

2. Compiler: In this task, a C file is compiled without linking to generate an object file.

3. Assembler: The task involves generating the assembly code of a C file and saving it in an output file.

4. Name: This task compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun".

5. Hello, puts: The program prints a specific string using the "puts" function.

6. Hello, printf: The program prints a specific string using the "printf" function.

7. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation: The program prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
8. 100-intel | Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file
9. 101-quote.c Prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" 
## Usage

Each task has its own script file that can be executed to perform the required action
